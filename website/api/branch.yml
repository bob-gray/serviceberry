    Routes requests at a path (segment) down a new branch. The path is cumulative.
    Creating a new branch only requires the next path segment. For example if a branch's
    path is `/widgets` a new branch created with `.at("{id}")` will have a path of `/widgets/{id}`.

    Path paramaters are delimited using a pair of curly braces. Such as `foo/baz/{id}/`.
    The branch will parse the path parameters. They are available to all handlers through the
    [request](request.html) object's methods [getPathParms](request.html#getpathparams) and
    [getPathParam](request.html#getpathparamname).

  - name: path
