type: class
extends: "[Leaf](leaf.html)"
description: |
  A branch is created by calling method .at() on the service
  [trunk](trunk.html) or branch.
methods:
- name: at
  returns: a new branch
  description: Routes requests at a path down a new branch.
  arguments:
  - name: path
    type: string
    description: |
      Paths are cumulative. Creating a new [branch](branch.html) only requires
      the next piece of the path. For example, if a branch's path is "widgets"
      a new [branch](branch.html) created with branch.at("{id}") will recieve
      a request to "widgets/42".

      Path paramaters are delimited using a pair of curly braces. Such as {id}.
      The branch will parse the path parameters. They are available to all handlers
      through [request.getPathParam(name)](request.html#getpathparamname)
      and [request.getPathParms()](request.html#getpathparams).
