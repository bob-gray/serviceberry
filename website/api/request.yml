name: Request
type: class
extends: "[EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter)"
description: |
  Request objects are created internally by Serviceberry and passed as the first
  argument to [Handlers](handlers). They are wrapper objects around Node's
  [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage).

properties:
- name: error
  type: HttpError
  description: Available within coping handlers.
- name: incomingMessage
  type: http.IncomingMessage
  description: |
    The preferred way to interact with a request is through it's methods, however
    if a need arises that is not addressed with an existing method, then direct access to the
    [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage)
    is available.
- name: latestResult
  type: any
  description: The resolved result of the latest finished handler.
- name: remainingPath
  type: string
  description: |
    The portion of the URL pathname that is after the current path of the currently executing handler.

methods:
- name: fail
  description: |
    Call this method to pass control of the request the nearest coping handler. Handlers receiving Request may
    optionally pass control by throwing an exception or by their return value in lieu of calling fail.
    See [handlers](handlers) guide.
  arguments:
    - name: error
      type: string or error
      description: |
        Can be a error message or an error object.
    - name: status
      type: number, string or object
      default: 500
      description: |
        Can be a status code, well know status text or an object with properties code and text. See
        HttpError methods [setStatusCode](httperror#setstatuscodecode), [setStatusText](httperror#setstatustexttext),
        and [setStatus](httperror#setstatusstatus).
    - name: headers
      type: object
      required: false
      description: |
        Response headers if fail results in the end of the request. These headers are not set on the
        response if a coping handler recovers from the fail and the request continues.

- name: getBody
  description: |
    Deserialized request content. Casing of param names is determined
    by the deserializer. Deserializers are encouraged to preserve case.
  returns: any (probably an object - determined by the deserializer)

- name: getBodyParam
  description: The value of a body param.
  arguments:
  - name: name
    type: string
    description: Case insensitive.
  returns: any

- name: getCharset
  description: Alias for [getEncoding](#getencoding)
  returns: a string

- name: getContent
  description: |
    After decoding (if content has a character set) and buffering (default) - before deserializing. Most likely use case
    is within a deserializer.
  returns: a stream, a buffer, or  a string

- name: getContentType
  description: Content mime type without encoding charset, such as application/json.
  returns: a string

- name: getCurrentPath
  description: The URL path of the currently executing handler.
  returns: a string

- name: getElapsedTime
  description: |
    Number of milliseconds since the start of processing the request.

    *Starts in the Request constructor and is not the same as time since the client sent
    the request.*
  returns: a number

- name: getEncoding
  description: Name of encoding such as utf-8.
  returns: a string

- name: getFullUrl
  description: |
    Full URL including protocol, host, path and query string.

    *Relies on Host header.*
  returns: a string

- name: getHeader
  description: Value is an array when header is duplicated.
  arguments:
  - name: name
    type: string
    description: Case insensitive.
  returns: a string or array

- name: getHeaders
  description: |
    All headers. Names are lower case and values are arrays when names
    are duplicated.
  returns: an object

- name: getHost
  description: |
    Host header value.
  returns: a string

- name: getId
  description: Unique identifier for the request.
  returns: a string

- name: getIp
  description: Remote IP address of the client making the request.
  returns: a string

- name: getMethod
  description: HTTP method (verb) such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE...
  returns: a string

- name: getPathParam
  description: The value of a path param.
  arguments:
  - name: name
    type: string
  returns: a string

- name: getPathParams
  description: All path params.
  returns: an object

- name: getParams
  description: |
    All params deserialized from the path, the query string
    and the request body. Will throw an exception if deserializing the params
    results in an exception.

    When params exist in more than one location such as both the path and
    the query string, the order of priority is path, then query string, then request
    body. Because of this ambiguity, it is usually preferable to use [getPathParms](#getpathparams),
    [getQueryParams](#getqueryparams), or [getBody](#getbody) instead of getParams.
  returns: an object

- name: getParam
  description: |
    Param deserialized from the path, the query string or the request body.
    Will throw an exception if deserializing the params results in an exception.

    When a param exists in more than one location such as both the path and the
    query string, the order of priority is path, then query string, then request
    body. Because of this ambiguity, it is usually preferable to use [getPathParm](#getpathparamname),
    [getQueryParam](#getqueryparamname), or [getBodyParam](#getbodyparamname) instead of getParam.
  arguments:
  - name: name
    type: string
    description: Case insensitive.
  returns: any

- name: getPort
  description: Port number of the request.

    content will be a [readable stream](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams).
    Calling pipe() sets the request content to the result of piping the request content stream through a transform stream.
  arguments:
  - name: stream
    type: stream
  - name: options
    type: object
