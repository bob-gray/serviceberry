name: Trunk
type: class
extends: "[Branch](branch)"
description: |
  A trunk should be created using [serviceberry.createTrunk(options)](serviceberry#createtrunk-options).
  All [branches](branch) and [leaves](leaf) originate from the trunk.
  A service has only one trunk.
methods:
- name: at
  returns: a new [branch](branch)
  description: Routes requests at a path down a new [branch](branch).
  arguments:
  - name: path
    type: string
    description: |
      Paths are cumulative. Creating a new [branch](branch) only requires
      the next piece of the path. For example, if a branch's path is "widgets"
      a new [branch](branch) created with branch.at("{id}") will recieve
      a request to "widgets/42".

      Path paramaters are delimited using a pair of curly braces. Such as {id}.
      The branch will parse the path parameters. They are available to all handlers
      through [request.getPathParam(name)](request#getpathparamname)
      and [request.getPathParms()](request#getpathparams).

    *The use case for this function is rare. Most of the time you probably want
    [.on()](#onoptions-handlers-).

    Routes request to a new [leaf](leaf). Works the same as [.on()](#onoptions-handlers-)
    expect it returns the new [leaf](leaf) instead of this trunk.
