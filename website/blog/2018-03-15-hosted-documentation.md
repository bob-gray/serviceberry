Thanks to many great tools for open source software, Serviceberry documentation is hosted. I'll be
continuing to work on cleaning up. Please take a look at the [Guides](/docs/getting-started.html)
and the [API Reference](/docs/serviceberry.html). Feel free to let me know what you think or let
me know if you notice any errors or omissions.
